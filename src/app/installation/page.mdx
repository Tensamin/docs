# Installation
You need to run the [Iota.jar](https://github.com/Tensamin/Iota/releases/) (currently not available...).

This is a Selfhosted server that you can run locally or on a server.
It manages your users and communities.

When you run the `Iota` you shouldn't change it's directiory.
The `Iota` creates configuration files and user directiorys, do not delet them.
When moving the `Iota.jar` move all created files with it.

Usernames are unique! That means if a name is taken it's taken for good.

With user creation a `<username>.pem` file is created next to the `.jar`, this file cannot be read by humans, it contains the private key of a user, the private key decrypts all the messages and configurations of the user on the `Iota`.

On the [Tensamin website](tensamin.methanium.net) you can login using your username and the `<username>.pem`.

How we store the `<username>.pem` file and how you should do it is explained in a [graphic]() (currently not available...).
How we handle loggin in is explained in a [graphic]() (currently not available...).
Our network structure is explained in a [graphic]() (currently not available...).
