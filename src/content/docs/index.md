## Development

Our version format is very simple:

- #### X.Y.Z (1.0.0)
  - **X:** Stable Release Number
  - **Y:** Beta Release Number
  - **Z:** Component Specific Release Number

#### Example:

- 4.2.0 - Frontend

In this case the **Tensamin Version is 4**, the **Beta Version is 2** and the **Iota has 2 more patches** for fixes
