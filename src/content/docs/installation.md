# OUTDATED! - VERY OUTDATED!!!

### You need to run the [Iota.jar](https://tensamin.methanium.net/release/Iota.jar).

This is a Selfhosted server that you can run locally or on a server.
It manages your users and communities.

When you run the `Iota` you shouldn't change it's directiory.
The `Iota` creates configuration files and user directiorys, do not delet them.
When moving the `Iota.jar` move all created files with it.

Usernames are unique! That means if a name is taken it's taken for good.

With user creation a `<username>.pem` file is created next to the `.jar`, this file cannot be read by humans, it contains the private key of a user, the private key decrypts all the messages and configurations of the user on the `Iota`.

On the [Tensamin website](https://tensamin.methanium.net) you can login using your username and the `<username>.pem`.

### You can also install the client for a better experience.
