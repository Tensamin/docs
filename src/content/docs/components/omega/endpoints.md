The `Omega` can be reached by HTTPS request from `Client` and `Iota`.
`Omikron` servers establish a Secure Websocket when booting.

This documentation is split into `Omikron` (WSS) and `HTTPS`.

```

## HTTPS
#### GET `/api/find_omikron/`

```
#### Possible errors:
`No Omikron found` level: `2`
#### GET `/api/find_omikron/<user-id>`
